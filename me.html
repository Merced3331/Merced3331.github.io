    <h1 class="solid center">About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="center no">My name is Marcello Merced and I grew up in Troy, New York. As a kid, I was always fascinated by
        music in my life and stories in movies and video games. I have always loved engaging characters with rich and
        deep backgrounds and development. This love for characters and writing led me and my brother to start creating
        stories of our own. After some time we found people that shared our same love for writing and created a team.
        Fast forward to 2022, I came up with a story that I was really excited about. A female investigator travels to a
        mansion on an isolated hill, where an entire family was brutally murdered to find out the mystery of what
        happened. But during her investigation she finds out that the ghosts of the family are still in the mansion. So
        now she has to free the spirits of the family in order to find out what happened. I tried to find a way to make
        This story fit a show format, but nothing I was coming up with was sticking. That's when the idea of making it
        into a video game came across my mind. Ever since then, I've been trying to learn how to make games so that one
        day <i>Murder on the Hill</i> could become a real game.
        Some of the games I enjoy playing are <i>DOOM Etearnal, Sonic the Hedghog, God of War,</i> and <i>Splatoon</i>.
        I feel that all of these games/game franchises have a fun and engaging game play loop that keep me coming back
        for more. Along with having great music and good stories, even if that is not the focus.
