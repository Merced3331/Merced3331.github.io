        This YouTube channel is what I can only describe as my biggest passion project. In 
        2022, I was inroled in a class at my high school called Media Production, where we would
        record and edit videos, edit images in Photoshop, and make commercials. Being in this
        class inspired me to create my own YouTube channel (something that I've wanted to do sense I was a kid).
        I started writing the script for what would become my first video that same year, but with how 
        bussy I always was I was never able to finish it. That was until 2025 where I finally buckeled 
        down during the summer and finished the script and filming.
