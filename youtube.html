        This YouTube channel is what I can only describe as my biggest passion project. In 2022, I was enrolled in a class at my high school called Media Production, where we would record and edit videos, edit images in Photoshop, and make commercials. Being in this class inspired me to create my own YouTube channel (something that I've wanted to do since I was a kid). I started writing the script for what would become my first video that same year, but with how busy I always was I was never able to finish it. That was until 2025 where I finally buckled down during the summer and finished the script and filming.

        <i>The Specialist (Of Media)</i> is a show created by, my brother, Michael Merced and made in
        part by <i>Plattsburgh State TV</i>. I've helped with making <i>Lego</i> skits for his
        episodes and have also had my own segments on the show as well. For episode 3 of season 1
        I made a special appearance announcing the red carpet. In episode 2 of season 2 I have my own small
        scale <i>Skinnyelbowz</i> video where I talk about <i>Lego</i> games.
